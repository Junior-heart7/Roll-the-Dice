# Roll-the-Dice
The basic premise of the game is this: you roll six dice. Some combinations of dice will score points, while others don't. You take out the dice that have scored points and then decide whether to keep that score, or re-roll the remaining dice to try to score more points. This game is actually fun to play with anyone you want "NO AGE LIMIT" lmao.
